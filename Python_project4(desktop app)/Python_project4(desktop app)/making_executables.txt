To create an executable program in python:
1)install pythoninstaller
2)point pythoninstaller to the mainscript.ie. pythoninstaller desktop-app
3)if you just want a single file without all th other files included for troubleshooting add --onefile
4)you would also want to include --windowed  ,as without it you will get a terminal, a command line running in the background with you GUI

In all it would look like this

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed mainscript.py

you can now share this program to anyone. If it invovles the use of current db, just send the db file along
with the executable file to the person.
