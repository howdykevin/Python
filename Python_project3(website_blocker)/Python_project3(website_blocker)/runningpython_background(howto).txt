#running a python in the background

1) Change the python file extension from .py to .pyw

2) Make sure the path to files are accurate. You need to pass in the long from "C://...." instead of "filename" even if the file is in the 
same directory as python script

3)Go to task scheduler, create a task.Configure for the operating system you are using. Mine is windows10. Check the option for running
with highest privilege so that you can access administration rights. Since you are changing the hosts file, you need to run as an administrator

4)Choose the trigger.(when do you want to run the python program.At startup etc

5)Choose the action tab. Choose the python program you want to run in the background.

6)go to settings and unchecked the battery settung so that you can run the program even when laptop is in battery mode

7)Done. now you can search for the task and run it manually/ restart your computer so that the program runs on startup

#Alternatively, if you want to just run and see whether python program is running in background
#without the need for administration right,

-> you can just double click on the python program
